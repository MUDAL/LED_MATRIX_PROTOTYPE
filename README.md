# LED_MATRIX_PROTOTYPE  

This project was developed for the **Hardware Things** competition I participated. My teammates were  
**Oluwasegun Adedigba** and **Adeboye Oyeniyi**; The prototype involves an ESP32 dev board and an two  
LED matrix modules. Each module has four 8x8 LED matrices cascaded. The aim of the project was to display  
**Welcome to Nigeria** in 16 different Nigerian languages.
